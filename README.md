# ThumbStack

ThumbStack produces stacked maps and profiles, given catalogs of object positions and maps.
It is designed for thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements.
It outputs 2D stacked maps and radial profiles for different filters (e.g., aperture photometry filters), 
as well as their covariances, estimated through several methods including bootstrap.
